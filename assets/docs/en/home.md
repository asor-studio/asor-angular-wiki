# Welcome to ASOR Studio

**ASOR Studio** (*Application Stability & Organizational Research*) is not just a library, but a development philosophy.

## The Mission

The project stems from a deep need for research in software engineering, focusing on two fundamental pillars:

1.  **Code Organization**: The search for an architecture that is not only orderly but semantically meaningful. Through the adoption of the *Atomic Design* pattern and a rigorous separation of concerns, ASOR Studio transforms disorder into structure, making code readable, maintainable, and scalable.

2.  **Data Conservation**: Improving application state management. ASOR Studio introduces a data management system that guarantees persistence and consistency, ensuring that information survives navigation and refreshes, protecting the integrity of the user experience.

The ultimate goal is to create an **optimal system**, capable of plastically adapting to both the daily needs of programmers and the stringent requirements of modern software. ASOR Studio is the answer to complexity, providing standardized tools for common problems, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate.
