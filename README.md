# ASOR Studio - Application Stability & Organizational Research

**ASOR Studio** (*Application Stability & Organizational Research*) is not just a library, but a development philosophy designed to tackle modern software complexity.

This project serves as the **official Wiki and Documentation** for the ASOR Studio ecosystem. It is an **Angular** application designed to demonstrate the library's capabilities and provide comprehensive guides on how to use it effectively.

## The Mission

The project stems from a deep need for research in software engineering, focusing on two fundamental pillars:

1.  **Code Organization**: The search for an architecture that is not only orderly but semantically meaningful. Through the adoption of the *Atomic Design* pattern and a rigorous separation of concerns, ASOR Studio transforms disorder into structure, making code readable, maintainable, and scalable.

2.  **Data Conservation**: Improving application state management. ASOR Studio introduces a data management system that guarantees persistence and consistency, ensuring that information survives navigation and refreshes, protecting the integrity of the user experience.

The ultimate goal is to create an **optimal system**, capable of plastically adapting to both the daily needs of programmers and the stringent requirements of modern software. ASOR Studio is the answer to complexity, providing standardized tools for common problems, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate.

## Key Features

The ASOR Studio Wiki covers implementation details for:
*   **Atomic Design**: Clear structure with Components and Molecules.
*   **Advanced State Management**: For granular data persistence.
*   **Centralized Configuration**: Unified management of routes, cache, logs, and translations.
*   **Powerful Utilities**: Ready-to-use tools for routing, object manipulation, and more.

## Project Structure

*   **Wiki/Docs**: This application is the living documentation for the library.
*   **Angular Powered**: Built with Angular 18+, utilizing the ASOR Studio library itself to demonstrate its features in a real-world scenario.
